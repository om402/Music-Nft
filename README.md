# Music-Nft
Music NFT minting using solidity
Non-Fungible Token is referred to as NFT. It is a kind of digital asset that denotes ownership or proof of authenticity of a special good or piece of material, including, but not limited to, artwork, music, films, collectibles, or virtual property.
Recently, music NFTs have flourished since producers may now sell their white-labeled music to customers directly, cutting out middlemen, and they can also profit from marketplaces' secondary sales. Numerous platforms exist, including Sound.xyz, Nina Protocol, Zora Music, and many others.

Music NFTs are minted as the same way as ERC721 tokens are but here we will be adding music in the meta data to IPFS using PINATA and that we will be creating a json file which will be holding our meta data which will be hosted on PINATA whose link we will be adding in our smart contract.
